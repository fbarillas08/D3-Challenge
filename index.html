          <p>During the Dutch Golden Age, Sir Peter Paul Rubens, one of the most influential painters in history specialized
            in the painting of afluent patrons.  Thus, the "rubenesque" model of beauty was born.  Ruben's subjects are
            characterized by their significant girth around the midsection.  Being obese was a sign of wealth and power.
          </p>

          <p>The correlation between wealth and obesity was clear in the 1600's.  The richer you were, the more food you
            could consume.  In the early part of the 21st century and for most of the 20th century, however, the opposite to
            has been the truth.  As shown in the graph above, as the median disposible income rises, the lower is the incidence
            of obesity.
          </p>

          <p>This risk factor is more commonly seen in lower-income brackets.  There are many factors that could explain this
            anti-rubenesque phenomenon.  Among them is greater awareness and health-conciousness among the more educated, better
            compensated sectors of the population.  As we map the food deserts in the different states, it is clear that lack of
            better nutritional options for lower-income classes directly affects their propensity to obesity and other health risks.
